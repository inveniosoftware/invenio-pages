Version 4.0.0 (released 2024-03-21)

- Major release because of fundamental change in the way the module is
  expected to be used for registering pages.
- global: remove `has_custom_view` model field
- views: allow passing Jinja context to `render_page`
- ext: remove finalize_app usage
    - The previous design of the module had some major usability issues:
        - The assumption that we have views that are dynamically registered
          without the need to redeploy/reload the application for code
          changes is fundamentally flawed. In reality order for such views
          to be accessible/discoverable, one has to be able to reference
          them in Jinja templates, which in turn means one has to make code
          changes.
        - The way we were registering page views, required having a
          connection to an already initialized database. This imposes having
          to perform checks at application initialization that go against
          well-established principles of the Flask/Invenio app lifecycle.
